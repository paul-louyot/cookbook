Pour the @water{3/4%cup} into a #small saucepan{} (which will be improved from the gastronomic point of view if it's flavored with orange juice, for example, or cassis pur√©e). Heat over medium-low heat and whisk in the @semisweet chocolate{8%oz}.

The result is a homogeneous sauce. Place the saucepan in a bowl partly filled with @ice cubes{} (or pour into another bowl over the ice - it will chill faster).

Whisk the chocolate sauce, either manually with a whisk or with an electric mixer (if using an electric mixer, watch closely - it will thicken faster). Whisking creates large air bubbles in the sauce, which steadily thickens. After a while, strands of chocolate form inside the loops of the whisk.

Pour or spoon immediately into ramekins, small bowls, or jars and let set. Serve immediately or refrigerate. Top with @whipped cream (optional){}, if desired.
