# Chocolate mousse


## Ingredients

- 159&nbsp;mL water
- 200&nbsp;g semisweet chocolate
- some&nbsp;ice cubes
- some&nbsp;whipped cream (optional)


## Steps

Pour 159&nbsp;mL water into a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat and whisk in 200&nbsp;g semisweet chocolate.

The result is a homogeneous sauce. Place the saucepan in a bowl partly filled with some&nbsp;ice cubes (or pour into another bowl over the ice - it will chill faster).

Whisk the chocolate sauce, either manually with a whisk or with an electric mixer (if using an electric mixer, watch closely - it will thicken faster). Whisking creates large air bubbles in the sauce, which steadily thickens. After a while, strands of chocolate form inside the loops of the whisk.

Pour or spoon immediately into ramekins, small bowls, or jars and let set. Serve immediately or refrigerate. Top with some&nbsp;whipped cream (optional), if desired.
