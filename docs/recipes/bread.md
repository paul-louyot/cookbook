# Bread

## Ingredients

- 1&nbsp;cup sunflower seeds
- 0.5&nbsp;cup flax seeds
- 0.5&nbsp;cup hazelnuts or almonds
- 65&nbsp;g hazelnuts or almonds
- 1 1/2&nbsp;cups rolled oats
- 2&nbsp;Tbsp. chia seeds
- 4&nbsp;Tbsp. psyllium seed husks
- 1&nbsp;tsp. fine grain sea salt
- 1&nbsp;Tbsp. maple syrup
- 3&nbsp;Tbsp. melted coconut oil
- 1 1/2&nbsp;cups water

## Steps

In a flexible silicon loaf pan combine 1&nbsp;cup sunflower seeds (135 g), 0.5&nbsp;cup flax seeds (90 g), 0.5&nbsp;cup hazelnuts or almonds (65&nbsp;g hazelnuts or almonds), 1 1/2&nbsp;cups rolled oats (145 g), 2&nbsp;Tbsp. chia seeds, 4&nbsp;Tbsp. psyllium seed husks (3 Tbsp. if using powder), and 1&nbsp;tsp. fine grain sea salt (add 1/2 tsp. if using coarse salt), stirring well.

Whisk 1&nbsp;Tbsp. maple syrup, 3&nbsp;Tbsp. melted coconut oil, and 1 1/2&nbsp;cups water (350 ml) together in a measuring cup. Add this to the dry ingredients and mix very well until everything is completely soaked and dough becomes very thick. If the dough is too thick to stir, add one or two teaspoons of water until the dough is manageable. Smooth out the top with the back of a spoon.

Let sit out on the counter for at least 2&nbsp;hours, or all day or overnight. To ensure the dough is ready, it should retain its shape even when you pull the sides of the silicon loaf pan away from it.

Preheat oven to 350°F / 175°C.

Place silicon loaf pan in the oven on the middle rack, and bake for 20&nbsp;minutes. Remove bread from silicon loaf pan, place it upside down directly on the rack and bake for another 30-40&nbsp;minutes. Bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped.

Let cool completely before slicing (difficult, but important).

Store bread in a tightly sealed container for up to 5&nbsp;days. Freezes well too – slice before freezing for quick and easy toast!
